Type: UI/UX Enhancement

Status: ✅ Completed

Priority: High

Overview
This implementation resolves the issue of double borders in bento-style dashboard containers and ensures consistent orange theme application across all components. The main problem was that dashboard components were wrapping content in Card components, creating nested containers with conflicting borders.

Issues Addressed
1. Double Border Problem
Issue: Dashboard components had their own Card wrappers inside bento containers
Result: Double borders (bento container + internal Card borders)
Impact: Visually confusing layout with inconsistent spacing
2. Button Styling Issues
Issue: Primary buttons losing orange background fills
Cause: Tailwind classes not properly defined + inline style overrides
Impact: Buttons appearing without proper styling in lesson management
3. Theme Inconsistency
Issue: Mixed use of gradients and custom color classes
Result: Inconsistent orange theme application
Impact: Design inconsistency across the application
Solutions Implemented
1. Teacher Dashboard Components Fixed
TeacherQuickActions.tsx
- <Card variant="default" padding="lg" className={className}>
+ <div className={className}>

3. Button Component Fixes
Button.tsx - Variant Styling
const variantStyles = {
-   primary: 'bg-learning-500 hover:bg-learning-600 focus:ring-learning-500',
+   primary: 'bg-[#ff6b35] hover:bg-[#e55a2b] focus:ring-[#ff6b35] text-white',
-   secondary: 'bg-achievement-500 hover:bg-achievement-600 focus:ring-achievement-500',
+   secondary: 'bg-white border-2 border-black hover:bg-[#ff6b35] hover:text-white focus:ring-[#ff6b35] text-gray-800',
-   ghost: 'bg-transparent border-2 border-learning-500 hover:bg-learning-500 focus:ring-learning-500',
+   ghost: 'bg-transparent border-2 border-black hover:bg-[#ff6b35] hover:text-white focus:ring-[#ff6b35] text-gray-800',
}

Button.tsx - Inline Style Override Removal
