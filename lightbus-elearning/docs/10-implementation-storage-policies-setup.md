# Storage Policies Implementation - LightBus E-Learning Platform

## üìã **Implementation Summary**

**Date:** January 6, 2025  
**Migration:** `007_storage_policies.sql`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Ready for Deployment  
**Impact:** Critical - Required for file upload functionality

---

## üéØ **Problem Identified**

During deployment preparation, it was discovered that **Supabase Storage bucket policies were completely missing** from the existing migrations. The application code in [`MediaUpload.tsx`](../src/components/lessons/MediaUpload.tsx) attempts to upload files to a `'media'` bucket that doesn't exist with proper policies.

### **Evidence of Missing Storage:**
- ‚ùå No storage bucket creation in migrations `001-006`
- ‚ùå No RLS policies for `storage.objects`
- ‚ùå Application expects `'media'` bucket to exist
- ‚ùå No file access controls or permissions

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Storage Architecture Implemented**

### **Storage Buckets Created:**

| Bucket Name | Public | Size Limit | Purpose | File Types |
|-------------|---------|------------|---------|------------|
| `lesson-media` | ‚úÖ True | 100MB | Teacher lesson recordings/materials | Audio, Video, PDF, Text |
| `user-uploads` | ‚ùå False | 50MB | User profile images, assignments | Images, PDF, Text |
| `media` | ‚úÖ True | 100MB | Legacy support for existing code | Audio, Video, PDF, Text |

### **File Organization Structure:**
```
lesson-media/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {lesson-id}/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {timestamp}_recording.mp3
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {timestamp}_slides.pdf
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ transcripts/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {timestamp}_transcript.txt

user-uploads/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {user-id}/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ avatar.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assignments/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ homework.pdf

media/ (legacy)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ media/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {timestamp}_file.ext
```

### **User Uploads Bucket (`user-uploads`)**
- ‚úÖ **Users:** Can only access their own user folder
- ‚úÖ **Admins:** Full access to all files
- ‚ùå **Public Access:** No (private user content)

### **Media Bucket (`media`)**
- ‚úÖ **Teachers:** Can upload and manage all files
- ‚úÖ **Students:** Can view all files
- ‚úÖ **Admins:** Full access
- ‚úÖ **Public Access:** Yes (backwards compatibility)

## üöÄ **Deployment Instructions**

### **Step 1: Apply Migration**
```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd lightbus-elearning

# Apply the storage policies migration
npx supabase db push

# Verify migration applied
npx supabase db diff --remote
```

### **Step 2: Verify Bucket Creation**
```sql
-- Check if buckets were created
SELECT name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types 
FROM storage.buckets;
```

Expected output:
```
name          | public | file_size_limit | allowed_mime_types
lesson-media  | true   | 104857600       | {audio/mpeg,audio/wav,...}
user-uploads  | false  | 52428800        | {image/jpeg,image/png,...}
media         | true   | 104857600       | {audio/mpeg,audio/wav,...}
```

### **Step 3: Test File Upload**
```powershell
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/lessons/upload
# Test file upload functionality
```

### **Step 4: Verify RLS Policies**
```sql
-- Check RLS policies on storage.objects
SELECT policyname, cmd, roles 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' AND schemaname = 'storage';
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Helper Functions Created**

### **1. File URL Generator**
```sql
SELECT public.get_file_url('lesson-media', 'lesson-id/media/recording.mp3');
```
- Returns proper URLs for public/private buckets
- Handles signed URLs for private content

### **2. File Organization**
```sql
SELECT public.organize_lesson_file(
  'lesson-uuid'::uuid, 
  'My Recording.mp3', 
  'media'
);
```
- Creates clean, organized file paths
- Handles filename sanitization
- Adds timestamps for uniqueness

### **3. Storage Metrics**
```sql
SELECT public.update_storage_metrics();
```
- Tracks total storage usage
- Monitors file counts
- Updates system metrics table

---

## üìä **File Type Restrictions**

### **Audio/Video Files:**
- ‚úÖ MP3, WAV, MP4 (up to 100MB)
- üéØ Primary use: Lesson recordings

### **Documents:**
- ‚úÖ PDF, TXT (up to 100MB)
- üéØ Primary use: Lesson materials, transcripts

### **Images:**
- ‚úÖ JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP (up to 50MB)
- üéØ Primary use: User avatars, screenshots

### **Blocked File Types:**
- ‚ùå Executable files (.exe, .bat, .sh)
- ‚ùå Archive files (.zip, .rar)
- ‚ùå Large video files (>100MB)

---

## üß™ **Testing Scenarios**

### **Teacher File Upload Test:**
1. Login as teacher
2. Create a lesson
3. Navigate to lesson upload page
4. Upload MP3 file ‚â§100MB
5. ‚úÖ Should succeed and store in `lesson-media/{lesson-id}/media/`

### **Student Access Test:**
1. Login as student enrolled in lesson
2. Access lesson media URL
3. ‚úÖ Should be able to view/download file

### **Permission Test:**
1. Login as student NOT enrolled in lesson
2. Try to access lesson media URL
3. ‚ùå Should be denied access

### **File Size Limit Test:**
1. Try uploading file >100MB
2. ‚ùå Should be rejected by bucket policy

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes**

### **Public vs Private Buckets:**
- **Public buckets** (`lesson-media`, `media`): Files accessible via direct URL
- **Private buckets** (`user-uploads`): Require signed URLs with expiration

### **RLS Policy Enforcement:**
- All policies check user authentication via `auth.uid()`
- Teacher policies verify lesson ownership through database joins
- Student policies verify enrollment through `lesson_participants` table

### **File Path Validation:**
- Folder structure enforces access control
- Teachers can only upload to their lesson folders
- Users can only access their own user folders

---

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Upload Fails with "Bucket not found"**
```sql
-- Check if buckets exist
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE name IN ('lesson-media', 'user-uploads', 'media');
```

### **Permission Denied on Upload**
```sql
-- Check user role and lesson ownership
SELECT p.role, l.teacher_id, l.id as lesson_id
FROM profiles p, lessons l
WHERE p.id = auth.uid() AND l.id = 'your-lesson-id';
```

### **Files Not Accessible**
```sql
-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'objects';
```

### **Storage Quota Issues**
```sql
-- Check storage usage
SELECT 
  bucket_id,
  count(*) as file_count,
  pg_size_pretty(sum((metadata->>'size')::bigint)) as total_size
FROM storage.objects 
GROUP BY bucket_id;
```

---

## üìà **Performance Optimizations**

### **Indexes Created:**
- `idx_storage_objects_bucket_owner`: Fast bucket + owner queries
- `idx_storage_objects_name`: Full-text search on filenames

### **Caching:**
- Public files cached for 1 hour (`cacheControl: '3600'`)
- Signed URLs expire after 1 hour for security

### **File Organization:**
- Timestamp prefixes prevent filename conflicts
- Folder structure enables efficient RLS policy evaluation
