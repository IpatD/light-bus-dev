# Implementation - Card Deletion Functionality for Teachers

## Overview
Added comprehensive card deletion functionality that allows teachers to safely delete flashcards they created, with automatic cleanup of related student review data.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Layer
**File**: `supabase/migrations/019_add_card_deletion_functionality.sql`

Created `delete_sr_card()` function with:
- ✅ **Security Checks**: Only card creators or lesson owners can delete
- ✅ **Data Cleanup**: Automatically removes related `sr_reviews` entries
- ✅ **Progress Reporting**: Reports how many student reviews were affected
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error messages

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION delete_sr_card(p_card_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE(success BOOLEAN, error TEXT, message TEXT)
```

### 2. Frontend Implementation
**File**: `src/app/lessons/[lesson_id]/teacher/page.tsx`

Added complete card deletion workflow:
- ✅ **Delete Button**: Red "Delete" button next to each card's "Edit" button
- ✅ **Confirmation Modal**: Safety confirmation before deletion
- ✅ **Loading States**: Visual feedback during deletion process
- ✅ **Auto-refresh**: Updates card list after successful deletion
- ✅ **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages

## Technical Implementation

### Database Function Logic
```sql
-- Security validation
1. Check user authentication
2. Verify card exists
3. Confirm user is card creator OR lesson owner
4. Count affected student reviews

-- Safe deletion
5. Delete sr_reviews entries (cleanup student data)
6. Delete the card itself
7. Return success with impact report
```

### Frontend Flow
```typescript
// User clicks delete → Confirmation modal → API call → Refresh data
handleDeleteCardClick(cardId) → showDeleteCardModal → handleDeleteCard() → fetchLessonData()
```

### UI Design
- **Delete Button**: Styled with red text (`text-red-500 hover:text-red-700`)
- **Hover Effects**: Red background on hover (`hover:bg-red-50`)
- **Button Grouping**: Edit and Delete buttons grouped together
- **Confirmation Modal**: Consistent with existing lesson deletion modal

## Security Features

### Access Control
- **Card Creators**: Can delete their own cards
- **Lesson Owners**: Can delete any cards in their lessons
- **Access Denied**: Others cannot delete cards

### Data Integrity
- **Cascade Cleanup**: Removes all related `sr_reviews` automatically
- **Impact Reporting**: Shows how many student reviews were affected
- **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing deletion ensures consistency

## User Experience

### Teacher Workflow
1. **Navigate** to lesson management page
2. **View Cards** in the "Recent Flashcards" section
3. **Click Delete** on any card they want to remove
4. **Confirm Deletion** in the safety modal
5. **See Results** - card disappears, success message shows impact

### Safety Features
- **Confirmation Required**: Modal prevents accidental deletion
- **Clear Warning**: "This action cannot be undone" message
- **Impact Visibility**: Shows that student data will be removed
- **Loading States**: Button shows loading during process

## Database Impact

### What Gets Deleted
```sql
-- For each deleted card:
DELETE FROM sr_reviews WHERE card_id = p_card_id;  -- Student progress
DELETE FROM sr_cards WHERE id = p_card_id;         -- The card itself
```

### What's Preserved
- ✅ Lesson data remains intact
- ✅ Other cards in lesson unchanged
- ✅ Student enrollments maintained
- ✅ Lesson statistics recalculated automatically

## Error Handling

### Database Level
- **Authentication Required**: Must be logged in
- **Card Not Found**: Validates card exists
- **Access Denied**: Checks permissions
- **Structured Responses**: Returns success/error/message

### Frontend Level
- **Network Errors**: Handles API failures gracefully
- **User Feedback**: Shows error messages via alerts
- **State Management**: Resets loading states on errors
- **Modal Cleanup**: Closes modals and resets state

## Testing Scenarios

### Successful Deletion
1. **Teacher creates card** → Card appears in lesson
2. **Teacher clicks delete** → Confirmation modal opens
3. **Teacher confirms** → Card deleted, list updated
4. **Success message** → Shows number of affected reviews

### Access Control
1. **Different teacher** → Cannot see delete button for others' cards
2. **Lesson owner** → Can delete any cards in their lesson
3. **Non-owner** → Gets "Access denied" error

### Edge Cases
1. **Card already deleted** → "Card not found" error
2. **Network failure** → Error message, modal stays open
3. **No permissions** → "Access denied" with explanation

## Integration with Existing System

### Consistent with Lesson Deletion
- **Same Modal Component**: Uses existing `ConfirmationModal`
- **Same Styling**: Matches lesson delete button design
- **Same Patterns**: Follows established error handling

### Student Impact Handling
- **Automatic Cleanup**: No orphaned review data
- **Progress Recalculation**: Student stats automatically update
- **Study Sessions**: Deleted cards no longer appear for students

## Files Modified
1. **`supabase/migrations/019_add_card_deletion_functionality.sql`**
   - New database function with security and cleanup logic

2. **`src/app/lessons/[lesson_id]/teacher/page.tsx`**
   - Added delete button to card display
   - Added confirmation modal and state management
   - Added delete handler functions

## Future Enhancements
- **Bulk Delete**: Select multiple cards for deletion
- **Soft Delete**: Mark as deleted instead of hard delete (with restore option)
- **Delete History**: Track what was deleted for audit purposes
- **Card Export**: Backup cards before deletion
