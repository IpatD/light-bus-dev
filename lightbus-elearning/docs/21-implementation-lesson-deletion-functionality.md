# Implementation: Lesson Deletion Functionality

## Overview
Added comprehensive lesson deletion functionality with proper security, confirmation modals, and user experience considerations. Teachers can now delete their own lessons with appropriate safeguards.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Layer
**Files:**
- `supabase/migrations/015_add_lesson_deletion_functionality.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/016_fix_lesson_deletion_function.sql` (Bug fix)

- **RLS Policy Added:** `Teachers can delete their own lessons`
  - Allows teachers to delete lessons where `teacher_id = auth.uid()`
  - Extends existing admin-only deletion policy

- **Function Created:** `public.delete_lesson(p_lesson_id UUID)`
  - Secure server-side function with proper authorization checks
  - Validates user permissions (lesson owner or admin)
  - Provides informative error messages
  - Handles CASCADE deletion automatically
  - Returns structured JSON response with success/error status
  - **Fixed:** Variable declaration issue in PostgreSQL function

### 2. UI Components
**File:** `src/components/ui/ConfirmationModal.tsx` (New)

- Reusable confirmation modal component
- Supports different variants (danger, warning, info)
- Loading states during async operations
- Accessible with keyboard navigation (ESC key)
- Customizable messages and button text

### 3. Teacher Lesson List Enhancement
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/teacher/TeacherLessonList.tsx`

**Added Features:**
- Delete button (üóëÔ∏è) for each lesson card
- Delete confirmation modal integration
- Real-time lesson list updates after deletion
- Error handling with user feedback
- Loading states during deletion process

**Functions Added:**
- `handleDeleteClick()` - Opens confirmation modal
- `handleDeleteConfirm()` - Executes deletion via RPC call
- `handleDeleteCancel()` - Closes modal and resets state

### 4. Individual Lesson Page Enhancement
**File:** `src/app/lessons/[lesson_id]/teacher/page.tsx`

**Added Features:**
- Delete button in header action area
- Confirmation modal with lesson-specific details
- Automatic redirection to dashboard after successful deletion
- Student count warning in confirmation message

**Functions Added:**
- `handleDeleteLesson()` - Handles deletion and navigation

## Security Implementation

### RLS Policies
- **Teachers:** Can delete only lessons they created (`teacher_id = auth.uid()`)
- **Students:** Cannot delete any lessons (no policy granted)
- **Admins:** Can delete any lesson (existing policy)

### Backend Validation
```sql
-- Permission check in delete_lesson function
IF v_lesson_record.teacher_id != v_user_id AND v_user_role != 'admin' THEN
    RETURN json_build_object(
        'success', false,
        'error', 'Permission denied. You can only delete lessons you created.'
    );
END IF;
```

## User Experience Features

### Confirmation Modal
- **Clear Warning:** Shows lesson name and consequences
- **Student Warning:** Alerts if lesson has enrolled students
- **Loading State:** Prevents double-clicks during deletion
- **Keyboard Support:** ESC key to cancel

### Error Handling
- Network errors displayed to user
- Permission errors with clear messages
- Database errors handled gracefully
- Console logging for debugging

### Visual Feedback
- Delete buttons with red color scheme
- Loading spinners during operations
- Real-time UI updates after deletion
- Smooth modal animations

## CASCADE Deletion Behavior

When a lesson is deleted, the following related data is automatically removed:

- **lesson_participants** - All student enrollments
- **sr_cards** - All flashcards for the lesson
- **sr_reviews** - All student review data
- **sr_progress** - All student progress tracking
- **transcripts** - Any lesson transcripts
- **summaries** - Any lesson summaries
- **processing_jobs** - Any AI processing jobs
- **analytics_data** - All analytics records

## API Usage

### Frontend Call
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('delete_lesson', {
  p_lesson_id: lessonId
})

if (error) throw error
if (!data?.success) throw new Error(data?.error)
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Lesson deleted successfully",
  "data": {
    "lesson_id": "uuid",
    "lesson_name": "Lesson Title",
    "student_count": 5
  }
}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Successful Deletion
1. Teacher clicks delete button on their lesson
2. Confirmation modal appears with lesson details
3. Teacher confirms deletion
4. Lesson is removed from database
5. UI updates immediately
6. Success feedback provided

### Permission Denied
1. Attempt to delete another teacher's lesson
2. Backend validates ownership
3. Returns permission denied error
4. User sees clear error message

### Network Error Handling
1. Delete request fails due to network
2. Error caught and displayed to user
3. Modal remains open for retry
4. No partial deletion occurs

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `src/components/ui/ConfirmationModal.tsx`
- `supabase/migrations/015_add_lesson_deletion_functionality.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/016_fix_lesson_deletion_function.sql` (Bug fix)
- `docs/21-implementation-lesson-deletion-functionality.md`

### Modified Files
- `src/components/dashboard/teacher/TeacherLessonList.tsx`
- `src/app/lessons/[lesson_id]/teacher/page.tsx`

## Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Backend Implementation**
- RLS policies configured
- Secure deletion function created
- CASCADE deletion working

‚úÖ **Frontend Implementation**
- Delete buttons added to UI
- Confirmation modals implemented
- Error handling complete

‚úÖ **Security**
- Teacher ownership validation
- Permission-based access control
- SQL injection prevention

‚úÖ **User Experience**
- Clear confirmation dialogs
- Loading states and feedback
- Responsive UI updates

## Next Steps

Consider these future enhancements:
1. **Soft Delete Option:** Archive lessons instead of permanent deletion
2. **Bulk Operations:** Select and delete multiple lessons
3. **Undo Functionality:** Allow recovery within time window
4. **Export Before Delete:** Backup lesson data before deletion
5. **Audit Trail:** Log all deletion activities for compliance

## Notes

- The implementation maintains database integrity through CASCADE constraints
- All related student progress and analytics data is permanently removed
- Teachers receive clear warnings about the consequences of deletion
- The function is optimized for performance with minimal database queries
- Error messages are user-friendly while maintaining security
