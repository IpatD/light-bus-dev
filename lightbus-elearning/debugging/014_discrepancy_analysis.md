# Student Data Discrepancy Analysis
## Student ID: 46246124-a43f-4980-b05e-97670eed3f32
## Date: 2025-06-07

## üîç Key Findings Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Working Correctly
1. **Timezone Alignment**: Dates are properly aligned between UTC and Warsaw timezone
2. **Progress Tracking**: Progress table is consistent with actual review data
3. **Review Recording**: All completed reviews are properly recorded with correct timestamps
4. **Data Integrity**: No timezone date mismatches found in historical data

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Discrepancies Identified

## 1. Study Streak Calculation Issue

**Backend Data:**
- `get_user_stats_with_timezone()` returns: `study_streak: 0`
- Last review completed: `2025-06-04` (3 days ago)
- Student has 3 completed reviews over 2 days

**Frontend Display:**
- Study Streak: `0` ‚úÖ **MATCHES**

**Analysis**: Study streak calculation appears correct - no consecutive daily study sessions.

## 2. Due Cards Count Discrepancy

**Backend Data:**
- Due Reviews Session Analysis shows: 1 pending review scheduled for `2025-06-10` (future date)
- `cards_due_today: 0` in user stats
- `total_cards_ready: 0` in today's stats

**Frontend Display:**
- Cards Due: `0` ‚úÖ **MATCHES**
- New Cards: `0` ‚úÖ **MATCHES**

**Analysis**: Correct - the one pending review is scheduled for the future, not due today.

## 3. Weekly Progress Array Issue

**Backend Data:**
```
weekly_progress: ["0","0","0","1","2","0","0"]
```
This shows:
- 3 days ago (index 3): 1 review
- 4 days ago (index 4): 2 reviews
- Total: 3 reviews in the last week

**Frontend Display:**
```
Weekly Progress: 0/7
Today's Data: {"day":"Sat","reviews":0,"date":"2025-06-06","isToday":true}
```

**üö® CRITICAL ISSUE**: Frontend is showing:
- **Wrong date**: `2025-06-06` (showing yesterday as "today")
- **Missing review data**: Not displaying the 3 reviews from the weekly progress array

## 4. Date Processing Discrepancy

**Backend Current Date:**
- UTC: `2025-06-07`
- Warsaw: `2025-06-07`
- Status: `DATES_ALIGNED`

**Frontend Current Date:**
- Showing: `2025-06-06` as "today" 
- **This is incorrect - should be `2025-06-07`**

## 5. Chart Data Processing Issue

**Backend Weekly Progress Breakdown:**
```
Index 0 (today): 0 reviews
Index 1 (yesterday): 0 reviews  
Index 2 (2 days ago): 0 reviews
Index 3 (3 days ago): 1 review   ‚Üê 2025-06-04
Index 4 (4 days ago): 2 reviews  ‚Üê 2025-06-03
Index 5 (5 days ago): 0 reviews
Index 6 (6 days ago): 0 reviews
```

**Frontend Chart Data:**
- Only showing today's data with 0 reviews
- **Missing historical review data from the weekly progress array**

## üîß Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Frontend Date Calculation
The frontend `mapReviewDataToChart()` function is not correctly:
1. **Determining today's date** - showing yesterday as today
2. **Processing the weekly progress array** - not mapping backend array indices to actual dates
3. **Displaying historical data** - only showing current day instead of full week

### Secondary Issue: Array Index Mapping
The backend returns a weekly progress array where:
- Index 0 = today
- Index 1 = yesterday  
- Index 6 = 6 days ago

But the frontend is not correctly mapping these indices to calendar dates.

## üîç Specific Problems to Fix

### 1. Frontend Date Helper Issue
```typescript
// In src/utils/dateHelpers.ts
// The date calculation is off by one day
```

### 2. Chart Data Mapping Issue
```typescript
// In mapReviewDataToChart() function
// Not properly processing the weekly_progress array from backend
```

### 3. Today Detection Issue
```typescript
// Frontend showing 2025-06-06 as "today" when it should be 2025-06-07
```

## üìä Expected vs Actual

### Expected Frontend Behavior:
- Show `2025-06-07` as today
- Display weekly chart with:
  - Today (Sat 2025-06-07): 0 reviews
  - Yesterday (Fri 2025-06-06): 0 reviews
  - Thu (2025-06-05): 0 reviews
  - Wed (2025-06-04): 1 review ‚ú®
  - Tue (2025-06-03): 2 reviews ‚ú®
  - Mon (2025-06-02): 0 reviews
  - Sun (2025-06-01): 0 reviews

### Actual Frontend Behavior:
- Shows `2025-06-06` as today ‚ùå
- Shows only today's data (0 reviews) ‚ùå
- Missing historical review visualization ‚ùå

## üöÄ Fix Priority

1. **HIGH**: Fix frontend date calculation (showing wrong "today")
2. **HIGH**: Fix weekly progress array mapping in chart component
3. **MEDIUM**: Verify timezone consistency in all date calculations
4. **LOW**: Add debug logging to track date calculation steps

## ‚úÖ Verification

The timezone migration **IS WORKING** - backend data is correct and consistent. The issue is in the frontend date processing and chart data mapping, not in the database functions.
