## Quick Start

### Apply All Policies
```sql
-- Apply complete policy set
\i database/policies/policies.sql
```

### Apply Individual Table Policies
```sql
-- Core learning tables (high security)
\i database/policies/lesson_participants_policies.sql
\i database/policies/lessons_policies.sql
\i database/policies/transcripts_policies.sql

-- User and content tables
\i database/policies/profiles_policies.sql
\i database/policies/sr_cards_policies.sql
\i database/policies/sr_card_flags_policies.sql

-- Analytics and interaction tables
\i database/policies/sr_progress_policies.sql
\i database/policies/sr_reviews_policies.sql
\i database/policies/student_lesson_interactions_policies.sql
\i database/policies/summaries_policies.sql
```

### Verify Implementation
```sql
-- Check RLS status
SELECT * FROM get_rls_status();

-- View active policies
SELECT * FROM policy_security_overview;
```

## Security Model Summary

### Role-Based Access Control

| Role | Description | Access Level |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Student** | Enrolled learners | Own data + enrolled lessons |
| **Teacher** | Lesson instructors | Full control over their lessons |
| **Moderator** | Content reviewers | Platform-wide content oversight |
| **Anonymous** | Unauthenticated users | No access (complete restriction) |

### Security Levels

#### High Security (Forced RLS)
- **Tables:** `lesson_participants`, `lessons`, `transcripts`
- **Protection:** Cannot bypass policies, even with elevated privileges
- **Use Case:** Sensitive educational and audio/video content

#### Standard Security (Standard RLS)
- **Tables:** All other core tables
- **Protection:** Policy-enforced access with system override capability
- **Use Case:** General educational data and user content

## Policy Distribution

| Table | Policies | RLS Type | Primary Security Focus |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| [`lesson_participants`](lesson_participants_policies.sql) | 5 | Forced | Enrollment management & classroom boundaries |
| [`lessons`](lessons_policies.sql) | 7 | Forced | Course content ownership & access control |
| [`profiles`](profiles_policies.sql) | 4 | Standard | User privacy & educational networking |
| [`sr_card_flags`](sr_card_flags_policies.sql) | 7 | Standard | Multi-tier content moderation system |
| [`sr_cards`](sr_cards_policies.sql) | 8 | Standard | Learning content sharing & discovery |
| [`sr_progress`](sr_progress_policies.sql) | 3 | Standard | Personal learning analytics protection |
| [`sr_reviews`](sr_reviews_policies.sql) | 2 | Standard | Study session data privacy |
| [`student_lesson_interactions`](student_lesson_interactions_policies.sql) | 4 | Standard | Engagement tracking & participation |
| [`summaries`](summaries_policies.sql) | 2 | Standard | AI-generated content access |
| [`transcripts`](transcripts_policies.sql) | 7 | Forced | Audio/video content & privacy compliance |

**Total: 43 Comprehensive RLS Policies**

## Key Security Features

### 1. User Ownership Validation
```sql
USING (user_id = auth.uid())
```
Ensures users can only access their own data, preventing cross-user data leakage.

### 2. Educational Relationship Validation
```sql
lesson_id IN (
    SELECT lesson_id FROM lesson_participants 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
)
```
Validates student enrollment in lessons, enabling appropriate content sharing.

### 3. Teacher Classroom Authority
```sql
lesson_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM lessons WHERE teacher_id = auth.uid()
)
```
Grants teachers full control over their classroom content and student interactions.

### 4. Role-Based Special Permissions
```sql
EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'moderator'
)
```
Enables platform moderation and quality control workflows.

### 5. Authenticated Public Content
```sql
is_public = true AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
```
Allows educational content discovery while preventing anonymous abuse.

## Management Functions

### RLS Control
```sql
-- Enable all RLS policies
SELECT enable_all_rls();

-- Disable all RLS (maintenance only)
SELECT disable_all_rls();

-- Check status of all tables
SELECT * FROM get_rls_status();
```

### Security Monitoring
```sql
-- View all active policies
SELECT * FROM policy_security_overview;

-- Count policies per table
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
GROUP BY tablename 
ORDER BY policy_count DESC;
```

## Educational Context

### Classroom Boundaries
- Teachers control access to their lesson content
- Students access only enrolled lesson materials
- Cross-classroom data protection maintained

### Content Quality Control
- Multi-tier flagging system for inappropriate content
- Role-based moderation workflow
- Community self-regulation features

### Privacy Protection
- Personal learning data remains private
- Student activity tracking with privacy controls
- Teacher content ownership respected

### Collaborative Learning
- Lesson-based content sharing between enrolled participants
- Public educational resource discovery
- Secure teacher-student interaction tracking

## Compliance Features

### Educational Privacy (FERPA)
- Student educational record protection
- Appropriate educational official access
- Parental consent workflow support

### Data Protection (GDPR)
- User data ownership and control
- Right to access and deletion support
- Consent management framework

### Platform Security
- Authentication required for all access
- No anonymous data access
- Session-based security validation

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Policy Design
- Minimal complex subqueries
- Optimized join patterns
- Indexed security-critical columns

### Scalability Considerations
- Role-based access patterns
- Lesson participation indexing
- User ownership optimization

## Testing & Validation

### Security Testing Commands
```sql
-- Test as student user
SET LOCAL "request.jwt.claims" TO '{"sub":"student-user-id"}';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lessons; -- Should show only enrolled lessons

-- Test as teacher user
SET LOCAL "request.jwt.claims" TO '{"sub":"teacher-user-id"}';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lesson_participants; -- Should show only their lesson participants

-- Reset session
RESET "request.jwt.claims";
```
